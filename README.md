# libdansdl

My original SDL1.2 wrappers.

# archiving

As of September 2022 it has been years since this was last used. There are some projects still depending on it, but versions may vary and the library should be packaged with them anyway. This repository will be no longer updated and will be marked as archived. If anyone ever wants to use this, be my guest but consider the libdansdl2 as a better alternative by my standards.
